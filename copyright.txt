the Sword of the Spirit as much as you want, and others may also do so. All we ask is that if you CHANGE the actual text of the Sword of the Spirit in any way, you not call the result the Sword of the Spirit any more.
This is to avoid confusion, not to limit your freedom. The Holy Bible is God's Word. It belongs to God. He gave it to us freely, and we who have worked on this translation freely give it to you by dedicating it to the
